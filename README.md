# μESP32
Hi! Welcome to my μESP32 project!
The purpose of this project is to make the smallest ESP32 development (dev) board that still has all the GPIO pins broken out for a user to play with!
## Goals
This project isn't seeking to solve a pressing issue, but it seeks to solve an issue none the less. These are features needed to solve the issue of the ESP32 Dev boards being very large and hard to use with a single breadboard.
* The μESP32 must be small, around the size of an Arduino Nano
* The μESP32 must have a built in USB to UART converter so it can be programmed without any additional hardware
* The μESP32 must be able to be powered over USB
* The μESP32 must have a reset button as it is sooo convienent
* The μESP32 must have a working on-board wifi antenna
* The μESP32 must be robust - It won't be easy to break and it will be a quality product
* The μESP32 must have status LEDs built in for users to play with
## Current Features

## Where I Am At So Far
Currently, I am on revision 0.6 of my μESP32. There have been 6 major iterations or redesigns since I have begun this project. Once I feel this project is ready to be released to the world, the current revision will become revision 1.0 and I will attempt to produce my design.
